## Tamagogo: Care and Collect
### by: Jake Zaia & Jennifer Zhang

To play our game: https://tamagogo.net

## Inspiration
Plant Nanny, an app that encourages you to drink water by having you empathize with a virtual plant.

## What it does
Tamagogo allows you to collect virtual pets by doing good for your community and helping save the planet. It's a great push for people who lack the motivation to do good things, but want to be a charitable member of society. It's also a fun game to play while you go about your day, to help you tally up your good deeds.

## How we built it
It is a Python flask app deployed with apache on a Digital Ocean Droplet. It uses mongodb as a database backend, and bootstrap to help present a clean user interface in the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Apache and flask do not like each other. Pixel art is hard and not the focus of a hackathon.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I got really good at making metallic looking pixel art (not coding but still proud of it!)
I fixed mongodb. Twice. Mongodb doesn't always want to behave.

## What I learned
When planning to deploy on apache, don't format a flask app as if its a flask app.
Don't trust mongodb without thorough testing.

## What's next for Tamagogo
If its popular? More goals, more collectibles and maybe a mobile app
